# Gorgonizer
A simple Go utility to organize your messy directories into folders by file type.

### The Problem
Let's be real, who cleans out their downloads folder regularly? (If you just said "me", prove it.) (If you just proved it, what's it like to be god's favourite?)

*My* download folder is a *m e s s*. When I want to find something I downloaded, very often I just go and find it online again and redownload it, because there's so much clutter.

### The Fix
Organize the folder into subfolders by file type, so there's a starting point to search for things later when you can't remember the file name.

### Must Haves
- [ ] When done running, directory is organized into sub folders by file type
- [ ] Flag to provide folder location
- [ ] Optional flag to have it organize subfolders
- [ ] Report on total number of files by type, and volume of data
- [ ] Optional flag for logging
- [ ] [All rubric requirements](rubric.md)
  

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Identify potential duplicate items for review by name
- [ ] Flag for keywords to identify potential themes (ie. "go homework" or "Dungeons & Dragons, D&D, DnD, d20) and either find them and pause for user input on whether an identified file should go in a themed folder or not (y/n), plus give the folder a name
- [ ] Use hashing to find duplicate items NOT by name

### Why "Gorgonizer"?
Go Organizer
But also, probably something clever in there about Athena being the goddess of wisdom and cleanliness being next to godliness and cleanliness + wisdom = organization? IDK this project is due in 4 days or something.
